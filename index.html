                <p> In George Orwell's 1984, Winston Smith wrestles with oppression in Oceania, a place where the Party scrutinizes human actions with ever-watchful Big Brother. Defying a ban on individuality, Winston dares to express his thoughts in a diary and pursues a relationship with Julia. These criminal deeds bring Winston into the eye of the opposition, who then must reform the nonconformist. George Orwell's 1984 introduced the watchwords for life without freedom: <span> Big brother is watching you.</span></p>

                <blockquote>"And when memory failed and written records were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested."</blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                "Orwell’s vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "Overall, 1984 conceptualizes a future which is gloomy, sad and controlling. It is a classic book and will forever be timeless and relevant as it correctly reflects our world today in many aspects; for that reason, those who are interested in relevant discussions regarding censorship, power, control and authoritarianism, should very much read this book - just for its political analysis alone even."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "The predictions for what 1984 could have looked like if it was a dystopian future' isn't far from the truth. The book was made 3 years after World War II, when political tension was really starting to pick up steam, and the date 1984 is just an inversion of when it was written, 1948. George Orwell himself was very far ahead of his time..."
